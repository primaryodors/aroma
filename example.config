# Sample AromaDock configuration file.
#
# Modify this or create fresh.
# Note that every parameter listed in this file can also be given as a command line
# argument, e.g.:
#
# bin/aromadock --lig sdf/acetic_acid.sdf  # Dock acetic acid using the same settings as for propionic.
#
# Note that if you override the PROT parameter, it is also recommended you override
# CEN, PATH, STATE, and EXCL (as applicable) since these will vary slightly from
# protein to protein.
#

# Path to PDB of protein (required):
PROT pdbs/OR51/OR51E2.active.pdb

# Optional: Add hydrogens to the protein after loading it.
# Strongly recommended if the PDB does not contain hydrogen atoms.
# HYDRO

# Path to PDB or SDF of ligand (required):
LIG sdf/propionic_acid.sdf

# Optional SMILES input string. This will override the ligand SDF file.
# It is not recommended to specify a completely different molecule from the SDF file.
# This feature is intended for instances where e.g. a ligand should be docked in an
# ionized state and the SDF contains a neutral uncharged molecule, or an internal
# arrangement of conjugated bonds in the desired ligand differs from the SDF, or any
# other variation not involving the addition or removal of heavy atoms.
# Note that if a --lig argument is specified on the command line, it will override
# any SMILES param in the config file.
# SMILES CCC(=O)[O-]

# Center of binding pocket (required):
# Can be ABS or RES; default is ABS if unspecified.
# ABS means use literal XYZ coordinates.
# RES means average the CA locations of all indicated
#     residue numbers or Ballesteros-Weinstein numbers.
# CEN ABS -4.93883 5.08067 -4.91533
# CEN RES 105 108 202 206 251 258
# Exclamation point means prioritize this residue for interactions with the ligand.
CEN RES 3.33 3.37! 4.57 4.60 45.52 5.39 5.47 6.55! 6.59!

# Optional required contact residues. These are residues that the ligand must bind
# to if possible. During dock, the ligand may not pull away from any of these residues
# if the binding energy between the ligand and residue is smaller than 5 kJ/mol.
# These can be thought of more as "sticky" residues rather than mandatory interactions,
# since the behavior is to move closer to each residue until the threshold coordination
# energy is met.
# Each REQSR is tied to a node number, in this case node zero. There is no limit to the
# number of REQSR parameters. If applying a REQSR to all path nodes, it is best to use
# the word ALL in place of a node number, so that the binding energies won't be reset
# between nodes.
# REQSR 0 6.55 6.59

# Optional path. If given, AromaDock will attempt to move the ligand along the
# path and report the binding energy at each node.
# The pocket center is considered to be node zero.
# Nodes must be numbered from 1 to n, where n < 256.
# Path can be ABS, REL, or RES. ABS and RES work the same as CEN above, while
# REL takes relative XYZ coordinates to add to the previous node's coordinates.
# Default is ABS if unspecified - NOTE this is different from the previous behavior
# where REL was the only option, so please update your config files!
# RES is particularly valuable when using STATE params, as detailed below.
# PATH 1 REL -2.0 -2.5 -0.5
# PATH 2 RES 112 206 251
# PATH 3 RES 115 213 244
# PATH 4 RES 59 118 240

# Pocket size. If one number is given, it forms the radius of a sphere
# centered around the pocket center. If three numbers are given, they form
# the XYZ radii of an aspect-ratio-distorted spheroid centered around
# the pocket center.
# Default: 10.0.
SIZE 6.0 7.5 5.5

# Optional exclusion zones. Useful for e.g. extracellular loops that in the real world
# protein would flex wildly and not constitute part of the binding pocket.
EXCL 1 57		# Head, TMR1, and CYT1.

# Optional "soft pocket" zones. Defines regions of the protein that are allowed to
# move around during docking, to accommodate ligands of different sizes.
# The number with a decimal point is a relative softness, in tenths of a degree maximum
# motion per iteration. All numbers without decimal points represent helix numbers,
# e.g. 1 = TMR1, 2 = TMR2, etc.
# All region numbers used here must be defined in the PDB file with REMARK 650 HELIX records.
# SOFT 1.0 2 4 5 6 7
#
# Optional "no delete" zones that must not be removed from the protein by the soft
# docking algorithm.
# NODEL 45.52 5.39
# NODEL 7.49 7.55

# Optional disappearance and reappearance zones.
# For a protein such as an olfactory receptor that is not always fully assembled inside
# the cell, but rather depends on the presence of agonists and/or antagonists to stabilize its
# structure, the docker can start with just a fragment of the protein and add the rest of it 
# back into the calculation piece by piece. The reappeared pieces can even be brought back in
# with a displacement away from pocket center. By combining this feature with soft docking,
# which has a built-in elasticity feature, the protein can be made to attempt to reassemble
# into its homology modelled shape, and the docker will report positional anomalies and
# internal contact anomalies resulting from the successful fit of a ligand too large for a
# rigid protein backbone.
#
# DISAPPEAR 0 170 9999      # At the start of docking, ignore all residues from 170 to the C terminus.
# REAPPEAR 20 4.65 5.68 7   # At iteration #20, bring back EXR2 through TMR5 with a displacement of 7 angstroms.
# REAPPEAR 30 1 9999        # At iteration #30, bring back the entire protein.

# Maximum number of poses to output. Default 10.
POSE 10

# Search method.
# Valid choices are CS (constrained), BB (best binding), or TS (tumble spheres).
# Constrained search chooses a single binding site residue, finds the best moiety
# from the ligand to coordinate to that residue, then rotates the ligand around that
# coordination site in order to find the best spatial positioning for it in the pocket.
# Best binding looks for the three pairs of ligand-side chain atoms with the best chance
# of forming a non-covalent bond, and attempts to align the ligand accordingly.
# Tumble spheres calculates the imaginary spheres the side chains can flex to inhabit,
# and free-form tumbles the ligand inside this space looking for the most favorable
# superpositions of ligand functional groups with side chain spheres.
# Default is BB.
# SEARCH BB

# Minimum total binding energy in kJ/mol for output poses.
# Normally this should be either a cutoff threshold for pose screening or a
# small negative number to find all valid poses. Setting this to a positive value
# may cause impossible poses to be output, e.g. ones where atoms are clashing.
# Note that there is also a per-residue clash limit and setting this value to a
# large positive number will not prevent filtering on individual residue clashes.
ELIM -0.01

# Uncomment this to enable kcal/mol output instead of the default kJ/mol.
# KCAL

# Side chain flexion: active if nonzero. Default: 1.
FLEX 1

# By default, only a few residues will be selected for flexion each pose, in order
# to agree with experimental data that most real world interactions involve three
# or fewer residue flexions:
# https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1097-0134(20000515)39:3%3C261::aid-prot90%3E3.0.co;2-4)
# But if a specific residue must flex in order to complete the dock, or must not flex
# in order to exclude non-agonists from the binding pocket, this can be set with
# FLXR and/or STCR parameters, respectively.
# Both residue numbers and Ballesteros-Weinstein numbers are accepted.
# FLXR 104 262 6.48                 # Force allow flexion.
# STCR 155 158 4.57 4.60            # Force prevent flexion.

# Optional: If this parameter is uncommented, AromaDock will generate up to the
# specified number of water molecules in the binding pocket.
# H2O 10

# Optional: If uncommented, this parameter will activate hydrophobic cohesion, which
# keeps nonpolar groups close together in simulation of an aqueous environment,
# without computing individual water molecules.
# WET

# Number of iterations per path node per pose.
# Higher values equal more precision but decreasing gains and longer processing
# times. Multiples of 10 work best. Default: 50.
ITERS 50

# Optional output file for docking results. Use a file path with filename,
# no spaces. If the file exists, it will be overwritten.
# For best results, include the receptor id (e.g. OR1A1, TAAR5) in the output filename,
# or use the placeholder %p which will auto-replace with the receptor id.
# The %l placeholder stands in for the ligand name auto-replacement.
